# Button

Button is a clickable interactive element that triggers a response.
 
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

## Props
<Controls />

## Usage
Set the asChild prop to true to pass the button styles to the components immediate child. This is useful when you want to render an anchor / link element or input as a button and maintain proper html semantics. Inspect the component below, you'll see that it is rendering an input element but appears as a button.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.AsChild} />

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Secondary} />
