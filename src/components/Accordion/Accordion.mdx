# Accordion

Accordion is a collapsible content container that can be used to hide or show additional content. It is useful for displaying information that is not crucial to the user's current task or workflow.

``` jsx
import { Accordion } from '@dbernardi/buttery-ui';

<Accordion
  id="accordion-1"
  title="Click to open/close"
>
  Accordion content that is revealed when the accordion is open.
</Accordion>
```

 ## Example
<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Primary} />
<Controls />
